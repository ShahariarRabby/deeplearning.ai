## Deep Learning Specialization
**Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI**

P.S: This repo **DO NOT HAVE THE ANSWER OF THE HOMEWORK** which respect the honour code of the Coursera.

## There is all the `ipynb` notebook and slides that associated with <a href="http://deeplearning.ai">deeplearning.ai</a>
* **There is no solution in the notebook**
* **All datafile added**
* **You Can download them and practice offline**
* **All slide added**

## Pre Trained Models
**Github only allows to share file less than 50mb. There is some pre-trained model like resnet etc. Suggest you to download them from My [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_HDHpsm_bIOkdo7aVkOcLsYxejilRujv) or download them from online (as they are so popular you can easily get them)**
